				<p id="proposal">We propose to upgrade your current on-line customer engagement processes with a new technology solution that includes multi-function capabilities not offered by other video conferencing solutions like Skype, Zoom, Duo, FaceTime or GoToMeeting, etc.</p>

				<h2>Key Differences</h2>

				<p>Our solution is designed for B-to-C engagement that includes integrated multi-function capabilities.  Depending on the service used, the other conferencing solutions are designed for B-to-B or C-to-C scheduled, real-time communication only.</p>

				<p>You cannot embed their service into your current online engagement processes or use them to create new customized processes that better align with your business needs.</p>

				<h2>Why Our Product Work</h2>

				<div>
					<p>Humans respond to visual interaction differently than text or voice alone. Psychologists refer to this as the “McGurk Effect”: what a prospect sees changes what they hear.  What they hear changes their behavioral pattern and decision-making process. The key stimulant effecting a change in response to content is direct eye contact.</p>
